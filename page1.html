    <p id="introtext">Botulism is an acute food poisoning, developing as a result of transmission to humans of botulinum toxin. Botulism is characterized by damage to the nervous system by blocking acetylcholine receptors botulinum toxin nerve fibers manifests itself in the form of muscle paralysis and paresis.</p>

Botulinum toxin produces bacterium Clostridium botulinum - gram-positive spore-forming bacillus, obligate anaerobes. Adverse environmental conditions are experiencing in the form of spores. Clostridial spores can be stored in a dried state for many years and decades, developing in the vegetative form when released into the optimum conditions for life: temperature 35 C, the lack of oxygen. Boiling kills vegetative forms of the pathogen within five minutes, the temperature at 80 ° C the bacteria is kept for half an hour. The spores can survive in boiling water for more than an hour and inactivated only in the autoclave. Botulinum toxin is easily destroyed during boiling, but methods are well preserved in brine, canned food, and foods rich in a variety of spices. The presence of botulinum toxin does not alter the taste of foods. Botulinum toxin is the most poisonous strong biological substances.

The reservoir and the source of Clostridium botulinum is the soil, as well as wild and some home (pigs, horses), animals, birds (mainly waterfowl), rodents. Clostridium host animal usually does not hurt, abjection occurs in the feces, the bacteria get into the soil and water, feed animals. Contamination of environmental objects clostridia also possible during the decomposition of the bodies of patients with botulism animals and birds.

The disease is transmitted by the fecal-oral mechanism by food. The most common cause of botulism becomes use canned at home contaminated with spores of the pathogen products: vegetables, mushrooms, meat products and salted fish.

A prerequisite for reproduction in Clostridium botulinum toxin accumulation products and the lack of access of air (tightly closed cans).

In some cases, the probability of infection of wounds and ulcers disputes that contributes to the development of wound botulism. Botulinum toxin can be absorbed into the blood from both the digestive system, and from mucous membranes of the respiratory tract, eyes.

People have a high susceptibility to botulism, even small doses of the toxin contribute to the deployment of the clinical picture, but often it is not enough concentration for the formation of anti-toxic immune response.

When botulinum toxin poisoning from canned foods are cases of family destruction. Currently, cases are becoming more frequent due to the spread of home canning. In most cases of botulism sick person from the age group 20-25 years.
<h2 id="headlines">Simptoms of botulism</h2>

The incubation period for botulism is rarely more than a day, most often, accounting for several hours (4-6). However, sometimes it may be delayed up to a week and 10 days. Therefore, monitoring of all persons who use the same food with the patient, continues up to 10 days.

In the initial period of the disease there may be non-specific prodromal symptoms. Depending on the predominant syndrome distinguish Gastroenterology, ocular embodiments, and - the clinical form of acute respiratory failure.

Gastroenterology is the most common option and flows by type of food poisoning, with pain in the epigastric, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea. Severity of symptoms of enteric moderate, however, there is inadequate total loss of fluid dry skin, and often patients complain of upset ingestion of food ("lump in the throat").

The initial period of botulism flowing through the embodiment of the eye is characterized by disorders of the eye: blurred, melteshenie "flies", the loss of clarity and reduced visual acuity. Sometimes there is severe far-sightedness.

The most dangerous with the current version of the initial period of botulism is an acute respiratory failure (sudden onset and progressive dyspnea, cyanosis spreads, cardiac arrhythmias). It develops very rapidly and threatens lethal after 3-4 hours.

The clinical picture of botulism in the midst of the disease is quite specific and is characterized by the development of paresis and paralysis of various muscle groups.

Patients marked symmetrical ophthalmoplegia (pupil steadily expanded, there is strabismus, usually convergent, vertical nystagmus, ptosis century). Dysphagia (swallowing disorder) associated with progressive paresis of the muscles of the pharynx. Initially, patients experience discomfort and difficulty swallowing solid food, then the development of the disease, and it becomes impossible to swallow liquids.

Speech disorder develops, passing successively four stages. First, changes tone of voice, hoarseness occurs as a result of insufficient moisture mucosa of the vocal cords. In the future, due to paresis of the muscles of the tongue appears dysarthria ("porridge in the mouth"), the voice becomes nasal (paresis of the muscles of the palatine curtains) and disappears completely after paresis of the vocal cords. As a result, disorders of innervation of the muscles of the larynx the cough is lost impetus. Patients can suffocate when inhaled mucus and fluid.

Botulinum toxin contributes to paralysis and paresis of mimic muscles, causing facial asymmetry, dismimiyu. In general, there is a general weakness, unsteady gait. In view of the intestinal muscle paresis develop constipation.

Fever is not typical for a botulism, in rare cases, possible low-grade fever. Cardiac condition characterized by increased heart rate, some increase in the peripheral blood pressure. Numbness, loss of consciousness are not typical.
<h2 id="headlines">Complications of Botulism</h2>

The most dangerous complication of botulism - the development of acute respiratory failure, respiratory arrest due to paralysis of the respiratory muscles or asphyxia airway. These complications can lead to death.

In view of the stagnation in the lung, botulism can cause secondary pneumonia. Currently, there is evidence of likelihood of complications of infection myocarditis.
<h2 id="headlines">Diagnosis of botulism</h2>

In connection with the development of neurological symptoms, the patient needs to be viewed from botulism neurologist.

Specific laboratory diagnosis of botulism in the early stages of infection has not been developed. The basis for diagnosis is the clinical picture and the epidemiological history data. Toxin was isolated and identified by using biological samples for laboratory animals. At the height of the disease is possible to determine the presence of toxins in the blood using an antibody to HGUF diagnosticum. Pathogen antigens are detected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), and - RIA and PCR.

Pathogen isolation by sowing feces bears no meaningful diagnostic information, as there may be the development of vegetative forms of Clostridium spores in the intestines of healthy humans.
<h2 id="headlines">Treatment for botulism</h2>

If you suspect botulism made compulsory hospitalization department with the ability to connect the ventilator to prevent and timely assistance in the event of life-threatening complications.

First medical event, produced in the early days of the disease, a gastric lavage using a thick tube.

Botulinum toxin circulating in the blood of patients, neutralized with a single administration of polyvalent serum protivobotulinicheskih method Besredka (after the desensitization of the body). If a single administration of serum was not sufficiently effective, and 12-24 hours later, the patient noted progression of neurological symptoms, the introduction of serum repeated.

Protivobotulinicheskoy fairly efficient administration of human plasma, but this drug is very rare because of the small shelf life (no more than 4-6 months). Currently, the treatment of botulism is used protivobotulinichesky immunoglobulin.

The set of measures causal treatment included antibiotics, appointed to suppress the probable development of vegetative forms of pathogen and kokarboksilaza and ATP. The positive effect of providing hyperbaric oxygen therapy.

The rest of the treatment is prescribed based on the severity and symptoms. In the case of the formation of acute respiratory failure patients transferred to the ventilator. Feeding patients in the case of forming the counter dysphagia produce liquid food through a thin tube, or transferred to parenteral nutrition.

During recovery a good effect in terms of early recovery functions of the muscular system is physiotherapy.
Hospitalization with the diagnosis "botulism"
For advice on the admission fee you can fill the form or call tel. 7 (499) 322-41-25. Patients with a preliminary diagnosis "botulism" may be admitted to the infectious diseases hospital №2, as well as other leading medical institutions infectious Profile Moscow .. Possible planned and urgent (within 24 hours) hospitalization. Service fee of hospitalization +7 (499) 322-41-25.
The prognosis of botulism

Forecast at a high dose of toxin and the resulting lack of timely medical care can be extremely unfavorable, the lethality of these cases reach 30-60%. Application etiotropic treatment and methods of intensive therapy in the development of severe complications significantly reduce the risk of death (up to 3-4%). If timely treatment of the disease ends in recovery with full recovery of functions in a few months.
<h2 id="headlines">Preventing Botulism</h2>

Preventive measures against botulism involve strict adherence to health and safety standards in the manufacture of canned food, sterilizing utensils for harvested products storage. Fish and canned meat products have extremely fresh and thoroughly cleaned from the soil particles form. Preservation of overripe fruit is not allowed.

Preserved in the home should be conducted in strict accordance with the formulation at a sufficient concentration of salts and acids in the open access of oxygen containers </p></div>
